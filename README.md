## 🚀 Features

- **Data preprocessing**: Resize images, augment with flips/crops/rotations, normalize.
- **Model definition**: Architecture using transfer learning (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet).
- **Training & evaluation**: Train models with loss/accuracy metrics, visualize training curves.
- **Inference script**: Upload an image to predict bird species.
- **Extensible**: Easily swap architectures or dataset.
