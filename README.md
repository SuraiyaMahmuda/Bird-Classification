# 🐦 Bird Classification

**Bird Classification** is a deep-learning project designed to identify bird species from images. Powered by PyTorch, it offers end‑to‑end capabilities—from data preprocessing and training to validation, testing, and inference.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Data preprocessing**: Resize images, augment with flips/crops/rotations, normalize.
- **Model definition**: Architecture using transfer learning (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet).
- **Training & evaluation**: Train models with loss/accuracy metrics, visualize training curves.
- **Inference script**: Upload an image to predict bird species.
- **Extensible**: Easily swap architectures or dataset.
